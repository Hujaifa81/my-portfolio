Motion is the language of the digital world. Every scroll, hover, and transition tells a story. The question is whether that story is intentional.

## Why Animation Matters

Humans are wired to track movement. It's evolutionary—motion meant either food or danger. In interfaces, this primitive instinct becomes a design tool.

### Motion Principles

Animation should serve function, not decoration:

- **Entrance choreography** — guide attention through staggered reveals
- **Physics-based motion** — springs feel natural, linear feels robotic
- **Exit awareness** — departures matter as much as arrivals

## Practical Patterns

The scroll-triggered reveal creates narrative pacing:

```tsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  viewport={{ once: true }}
  transition={{ 
    type: "spring", 
    damping: 25, 
    stiffness: 120 
  }}
>
  Content appears with intention
</motion.div>
```

## Performance Considerations

Animation done wrong destroys performance. The key rules:

- Transform and opacity only—never animate layout properties
- Use `will-change` sparingly and remove when done
- Check GPU memory on mobile devices
- Prefer CSS animations for simple transitions

> "Sixty frames per second is the baseline, not the goal."

The best animation is invisible. Users should feel the effect without noticing the cause. When someone comments on your animation, you've likely overdone it.
