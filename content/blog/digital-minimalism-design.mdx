In a world screaming for attention, silence is revolutionary. The most powerful interfaces aren't loud—they're precise.

## The Paradox of Choice

Every element on screen competes for cognitive bandwidth. The more options we present, the harder it becomes for users to act. This isn't opinion—it's neuroscience.

### Principles of Reduction

The void is not empty. It's potential energy:

- **Negative space** — breathing room for the mind
- **Hierarchy through absence** — what you remove defines what remains
- **Motion with purpose** — animate only what matters

> "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

## Implementing Minimalism

Minimalism isn't about having less. It's about making room for more of what matters.

```css
.element {
  /* Remove before you add */
  all: unset;
  
  /* Then add only what's essential */
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

## The Void as Canvas

Dark themes aren't just aesthetic—they're functional. The void-black background of this portfolio isn't darkness; it's space for ideas to emerge. Each neon highlight exists because everything else was removed.

In the digital realm, restraint is the ultimate luxury.
