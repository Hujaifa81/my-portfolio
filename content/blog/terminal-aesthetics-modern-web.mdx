There's something primal about the terminal. Pure text. No hiding behind gradients and drop shadows. Just you, the machine, and raw information.

## The Terminal Renaissance

Developers never left the command line, but now the aesthetic is bleeding into mainstream design. TUIs (Terminal User Interfaces) are having a moment.

### Elements of Terminal Design

The visual language is minimal but precise:

- **Monospace typography** — every character aligned in the grid
- **Cursor blinking** — life indicator of an active system
- **Scan line effects** — CRT nostalgia as design choice
- **ASCII art** — graphics through constraint

## Building Terminal Components

The About section of this portfolio uses terminal aesthetics:

```tsx
const TerminalText = ({ text }: { text: string }) => {
  const [displayed, setDisplayed] = useState('');
  
  useEffect(() => {
    let i = 0;
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setDisplayed(text.slice(0, i));
      i++;
      if (i > text.length) clearInterval(interval);
    }, 50);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [text]);
  
  return <span>{displayed}<span className="cursor">_</span></span>;
};
```

> "In a world of abstractions, the terminal offers truth. There's no loading spinner lying to you about progress."

## The Psychology of Hacker Aesthetics

Terminal design signals competence. It says "I speak the machine's language." This isn't gatekeeping—it's a form of trust signaling. When users see terminal output, they expect precision.

The green-on-black isn't just nostalgic. It's functional. High contrast, low eye strain, timeless.

Welcome to the grid.
